        <h2>Site Objectives</h2>
        <p>For the digital arts project, I aim to create a visual anthology, accessible on this website that forms part 
          of the complete project. In this project, I will explore one of the ways one can create innovative artwork using intermediality. 
          Furthermore, exploring possible ways to communicate information and explore storytelling through digital platforms. 
          My project is called Meraki, Meraki is a Greek word which means to do something with soul, creativity, and love, or to 
          put something of oneself into one's work.</p>

        <p> My visual anthology forms part of the digital storytelling landscape. Through this anthology I 
          aim to challenge myself creatively and to reflect on the work done throughout the degree this year. I explore the creative 
          component of coding, whilst discovering various ways of shaping code to get a creative output. Moreover, I explore the ways 
          in which one can create innovative artwork using intermediality and poetry.</p>

        <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
        <p>My main personal objective for this project is to further enhance and explore technical skills. I, therefore, have placed 
          enhancing my technical skill as the highest ranking skill, followed by public speaking. As an aspiring digital artist and 
          overall creative, I find it important that I be able to communicate my ideas and concepts. Therefore, I have selected public 
          speaking as the second most important skill that I wish to enhance.</p>
          
          <p>My final top 3 skill is in management. I chose management 
          as I will mostly be working independently in my business for the first few years, being able to manage various parts of a 
          project to achieve a single end goal is vital to the success of the final product</p>

        <h2>Artistic Goals</h2>
        <p>In my artistic goals, innovation ranks the highest, as I find it a crucial part of creating an artefact. I then ranked 
          quality work and enhancing artistic skills equally important. In the work I aim to produce I consider quality a vital part 
          of the final experience, furthermore, I believe that acquiring knowledge of various concepts as one creates, helps to improve 
          various skills allowing for increased quality.</p>
