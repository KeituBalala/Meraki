<h1>Final Reflective Essay</h1>

<h2 style="padding-top: 7%;">Introduction</h2>

    <p>I have recently completed the first and second phases of my interactive graphic novel. In these phases, I focused on setting the technical 
        and creative foundations for the project. Besides not having a set idea of what story I hope to tell, I found it productive to dedicate 
        the early stages of the project to ensure that the platform and means, through which I hope to share my story, have been identified, 
        developed, and completed. </p>
    
    <p>In this reflective document, I aim to demonstrate and reflect on my creative journey thus far. I will be reflecting on my chosen 
        artwork’s theoretical background that helped establish some of my creative decisions, indicate my goals and objectives in rubric 
        format (see appendix a), demonstrate my work log and reflect on work completed.</p>
    
    <p>Through my interactive graphic novel, I will exhibit crossing genres by creating an intermedial narration artefact. I intend to 
        design and create an artefact that embodies digital storytelling. In order to achieve this, I firstly established a theoretical 
        understanding of the tasks involved in acquiring a creative foundation for the artefact. These tasks included building a functioning 
        website, exploring concepts of intermediality, and incorporating increased interactivity.</p>
    
    <h2>Artefact background</h2>
    
    <h3>Website</h3>

    <p>In Interactive media, I created a website for first semester, however, I focused most of my time on gaining technical competence. 
        With this project I aim to explore the creative component of coding, I look forward to discovering various ways of shaping code to 
        get a creative output.</p>
    
    <h3>Interactivity</h3>

    <p>One of the main elements of digital arts that I have been introduced to, is interactivity. I have gained understanding of the role 
        and importance of interactivity in digital artefacts, specifically for user experience and interface. As a result, a major part of 
        my artefact involves creating an interactive graphic novel.</p>
    
    <h3>Intermediality</h3>

    <p>In digital arts theory, we explored the various forms of intermediality, digital storytelling and various digital vernaculars. 
        For my digital arts theory artefact I created videos, in meme format, whereby I presented poems into a new media. In this project 
        I will further explore the ways in which one can create innovative artwork using intermediality.</p> 
    
    
    <h2>Work Log</h2>
    
    <p>For my project progress, I have created a project completion schedule . My project schedule reflects the tasks I hope to complete 
        throughout, to achieve the final project output of an interactive graphic novel(s). Each task has a predicted date of completion 
        that correlates to expected feedback and Crits sessions. I have also added an actual task completion date, that allows me to track 
        my progress and be able to see where I fall behind. Currently I have completed:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li> The website landing page </li>
    <li> The website wireframes</li>
    <li> The about page</li>
    <li> The reflection documents index page</li>
    <li> The presentation index page</li>
    <li> The experience option page </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Reflection On Work Completed</h2>
    
    <p>Designing the website style and layout took more time than anticipated, I was constantly back and forth in deciding and establishing 
        direction, regarding how I would communicate and create a consistent atmosphere throughout the website.  I hoped to achieve an 
        atmosphere that gains the user's attention and curiosity, as well as, elicits excitement. I, however, discovered that in pursuing 
        to attract user attention and elicit excitement, it is possible to overwhelm their senses. On my website, I made excessive use of 
        a singular colour and made certain objects larger than necessary whilst other important elements blended into the background.</p>
    
    <p>Upon reflection, I found that the setback in designing the website was caused by challenging my creativity based on what I can already 
        achieve in the technical aspect, rather than challenging my technical skills by attempting to achieve what I envisioned creatively. 
        As a result, I was trying to achieve too much using limited resources.  Therefore, for the next phase of the project, alongside 
        officially developing and incorporating the digital storytelling aspect of my project, I wish to adjust my website design to provide 
        an exciting atmosphere for users without overwhelming their senses. Currently, to achieve this, I am exploring the use of colours, 
        white space, scaling down of object sizes, and incorporating other forms of media (intermediality) into the website to assist in 
        achieving the desired website atmosphere.</p>
    
    <p>Based on my current progress I have not made adequate use of intermediality. One of my identified tasks that form part of the creative 
        foundation for my artefact, is exploring intermediality. I was introduced to the concept of intermediality in digital arts theory and 
        hope to use this as one of the ways through which I can explore innovative digital storytelling. Klaus Jensen gives a detailed 
        definition of intermediality as “the interconnectedness of modern media of communication. As a means of expression and exchange, 
        different media refer to and depend on one another, both explicitly and implicitly; they interact as elements of various communicative 
        strategies, and they are constituents of a wider social and cultural environment.” (Jensen 2016:1). To add to the website experience, 
        I will explore intermediality further, through incorporating media such as audio, written text with focus on the font, as well as, 
        visual communication such as images and gifs.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, based on expected progress, the website user interactivity is one of the tasks that I am satisfied with. My theoretical 
        orientation for interactivity is based on Aaron Smuts’ definition. Smuts defines interactivity as when something is 
        <cite>“(1) responsive, (2) does not completely control, (3) is not completely controlled, and (4) does not respond in a completely 
            random fashion”</cite> (Smuts, 2009:65).  The main areas of added interactivity are whereby I have provided users with options and the 
            opportunity to select the format in which they wish the novel to be presented, furthermore, the novel only continues to the next 
            frame or story once the user commands it to, based on them clicking or scrolling. I do hope to increase interactivity, by 
            incorporating more user experience options.</p>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    
    <p>Currently, I am up to date with the expected tasks completion dates, based on my project schedule. The tasks that make up the creative 
        foundation for the artefact have all been adequately achieved with certain features requiring improvement. I was able to identify and 
        allocate the main reasons for setbacks in each of the three components that make up the artefact creative foundation. Shortfalls or 
        setbacks in achieving the expected website atmosphere were due to personal idiosyncratic issues and shortfalls in exploring 
        intermediality were due to deviating or not adequately responding to the theory forming part of the discipline. In the next phase of my 
        project, I will address the socio-cultural factors of my artefact, through the use of digital storytelling.</p>
